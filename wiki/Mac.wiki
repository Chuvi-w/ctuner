= Introduction =

A Mac version is in development. Slow going so far...

= Progress =

  * The basic layout and graphics are done.
  * The audio capture and processing system is working.

== Differences ==

There are a number of differences from the Windows version:

  * Clicking on panes to change options doesn't work.
  * The Mac audio system calculates the actual sample rate, so correction is redundant.
  * The Mac version currently uses more CPU time.
  * The volume control is independent from the sound input volume control in System Preferences.
  * The strobe pane animation is jerkier, due to the type of timer available on the Mac.
  * Resize display is currently somewhat of a kludge. To resize, type 'R', or click the resize check box. Nothing happens. Restart the app and it comes up resized. There must be a better way to do this, but I haven't found it yet.
