== Differences ==

There are a number of differences from the Windows version:

  * The Mac audio system calculates the actual sample rate, so correction is redundant.
  * The volume control has been removed as it does not work in version 10.8 (Lion).
  * The strobe pane animation is jerkier, due to the type of timer available on the Mac.
  * Clicking on the window upsets the audio system momentarily.
  * Use the zoom button to resize the window.
  * Uses the mac vDSP library for audio analysis.
  * Options may be changed by pressing keys, they are:
    * C, Ctrl-C - Copy values to clipboard
    * D - Switch downsampling on and off
    * F - Switch filter on and off
    * L - Lock display
