= Progress =

  * The basic layout and graphics are done.
  * The audio capture and processing system is working.

  * There are a number of differences from the Windows version:
    * Clicking on panes to change options doesn't work.
    * The Mac audio system calculates the actual sample rate, so correction is redundant.
    * The Mac version currently uses more CPU time.
    * The volume control is independent from the audio input volume control in the System Preferences application.
    * The strobe pane animation is jerkier, due to the type of timer available on the Mac.
