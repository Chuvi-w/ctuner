= Progress =

  * The basic layout and graphics are done.
  * The audio capture and processing system is working.
  * Updated version released.

== Differences ==

There are a number of differences from the Windows version:

  * The Mac audio system calculates the actual sample rate, so correction is redundant.
  * The volume control is independent from the sound input volume control in System Preferences.
  * The strobe pane animation is jerkier, due to the type of timer available on the Mac.
  * Clicking on the window upsets the audio system momentarily.
  * Use the zoom button to resize the window.
  * Uses the mac vDSP library for audio analysis.
